# CECS-450-Proj-2

For our CECS 450 Project, we decided to create a Heat Map visualization that allows the user to individually pick which participant they wish to see based off of the given Eye Gaze Data and watch the Heat Map form. The user also has the ability to choose if they wish to see the Indented List data or the Tree Graph data in this visualization.
